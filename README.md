# EN-TechDock
EN-TechDock is our MacOS Dock which works seamlessly with Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and even 10. This Dock is gonna make your old laptop look like a brand new Mac with our seamless design and our trustable source code developers. You can also choose MacOS Catalina dock or MacOS Big Sur dock. Whichever your comfortable with. EN-TechDock also comes with the new MacOS Big Sur 11 refreshed icons with uniform design and rounded corners. 

# EN-Tech Developers
Our Developers are one of a kind. From our Head. 
Elkin Ranjith all the way to our senior Architect Nathan Stanley. 
EN-TechDock was first an idea from Elkin Ranjith to emulate the MacOS experience on Windows 10, 8.1, 8, XP, & 7. 
This was soon continued by him and Nathan Stanley together to accomplish what you see now.
